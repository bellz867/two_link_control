# two_link_control
Various nonlinear adaptive controllers leading up to doing deep adaptive control using a two-link arm for simulation.
Different branches have various strategies leading up to a deep adaptive control strategy. Most will also have a pdf explaining the math behind the code.
I chose a two-link because it is relatively easy to picture and the desired trajecteory is basically picking up a drink.
Hope you enjoy and can adapt this to your own problems!
